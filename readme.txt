Amazon KDP is pretty cryptic.  The only way you can tell how well someone else's Kindle ebook is doing is by checking out that ebook's Best Seller Rank.  

<h4>But what does that mean?</h4>

Thanks to the Kindle Best Seller Calculator plugin, you and  your readers no longer have to try to figure it out.  Just download this plugin, add it to a specific page or your sidebar and viola, you now know how many books per day any Kindle book on Amazon sells. 

<h4>How this will Help Your Website</h4>

Not only will this be valuable for your own Kindle eBook research, by having this plugin on your website, you will have a valuable tool that  your readers will love to use.  

Basically, when they want to know how much money someone is making with their kindle book, they will go to your website, and use the Calculator every time.  This is an incredible way to get your readers to come back for more and find more value in your site.

If you want to place the plugin on a sidebar:

== Screenshots ==

1. The Kindle Best Seller Calculator as it looks on your side bar
2. Once you place the Best Seller Rank and click "Click Here,"  the Kindle Best Seller Calculator will calculate the "Sales Per Day" for that particular book.
3. To place this on a sidebar, you need to drop and drop a Text widget into the sidebar and then add the shortcode [Kindle-rank-calculator] to it.  
4. What's even cooler is that our shortcode [Kindle-rank-calculator] works on pages and not just on sidebars. So create your own page specific calculation...which is nice.
